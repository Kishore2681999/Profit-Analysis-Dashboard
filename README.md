# Profit Analysis Dashboard using Looker Studio

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales, profits, and shipping data across different U.S. regions to provide actionable insights that improve business strategies. The key goal is to enhance profitability by optimizing shipment modes and identifying high-performing regions.

## Problem Statement
The primary challenge was to evaluate sales and profit margins across various regions, product categories, and shipment methods. Understanding these variables helps businesses make informed decisions to increase overall profit while maintaining efficient logistics.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains information on sales, profit, shipping modes, and product categories, segmented by U.S. state and city.
- **Data Fields**: 
  - `Region`, `State`, `City`
  - `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`
  - `Ship Mode`, `Category`

## Insights Generated
- **Regional Profit Analysis**: Profit margins vary significantly across regions. The West and East regions contributed the most to overall sales.
- **Category Analysis**: Technology products showed the highest profit margins, while Office Supplies had a lower profit-to-sales ratio.
- **Ship Mode Efficiency**: Standard Class shipping emerged as the most cost-effective method, while Second-Class shipping though faster, incurred higher costs with little added profit.
- **State and City-Level Insights**: New York City and Los Angeles generated the highest profit margins, providing opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory management.


## Future Scope
- **Predictive Analysis**: Implement machine learning models to predict future sales trends and potential profit margins.
- **Deep Dive on Customer Segmentation**: Further analysis on customer purchasing patterns based on geographical and demographic data.
